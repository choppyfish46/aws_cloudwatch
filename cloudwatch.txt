Problem Statement

Create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an email using SNS notification when CPU Utilization is more than 70%.
Creating a Status Check Alarm to check System and Instance failure and send an email using SNS notification

Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time.
 You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications.


 EC2/Host Level Metrics that CloudWatch monitors by default consist of
CPU
Network
Disk


There are two types of status check
System status check: Monitor the AWS System on which your instance runs.
 It either requires AWS involvement to repair or you can fix it by yourself by just stop/start the instance(in case of EBS volumes).
 Examples of problems that can cause system status checks to fail

 Loss of network connectivity
* Loss of system power
* Software issues on the physical host
* Hardware issues on the physical host that impact network reachability


Instance status check: Monitor the software and network configuration of an individual instance.
 It checks/detects problems that require your involvement to repair.
 Incorrect networking or startup configuration
* Exhausted memory
* Corrupted filesystem
* Incompatible kernel
